		<h2>Improvements</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Simplified interface so that users can more easily figure out what to do.</li>
			<li>Increased contrast between channels and messages so they're more clearly distinct. Also changed wording to
				make this difference more apparent.</li>
			<li>When a button is pressed, it now changes color to a darker hue to indicate that it's pressed.</li>
			<li>Rather than a third panel for displaying extra option, they now appear in a pop-up over the main screen.</li>
			<li>Rounded corners of rectangles to make the general feel more cozy--also helped to make it clearer 
				what are buttons and windows</li>
			<li>Pop-up menus are simpler, clearer, and more direct with the information they give, so that multiple clicks from
				one pop-up to another are no longer required.
			</li>
